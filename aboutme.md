title: About me
subtitle: My story
---

I am a Mechanical Engineering M.Sc. student with a passion for Control, Robotics, and Biomechanics. I have worked part time for over three years as an Energy Systems Modeling Engineer at [Brightmerge](https://www.brightmerge.com/) during my BSc., and currently I'm conducting research at the [Neurobotics and Bionic Limbs Lab](https://enabletechnion.com/). My current focus is on modifying the Control of a Powered lower limb prostheses by introducing intersegmental coordination in an attempt to reduce the metabolic cost in amputees. Our rationale is that current prosthesis controllers may be following a joint trajectory or a joint impedance model correctly, but are not coordinating correctly. 

In my spare time I am tutoring an undergraduate anvanced robotics lab course focused on a gantry robot (Motion Control and System ID)  

My main interests include:
- Biomechanics and Bionics
- Control Theory
- Robotics
- Machine Learning
