# Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:
## Kinematics Dynamics and Control of Robots (KDCR)
- **Description**: Kinematics Dynamics and Control of Robots course work. It included trajectory planning and control of serial and parallel robots. [View on Github](https://github.com/eladsimantov/KDCR?tab=readme-ov-file#kinematics-dynamics-and-control-of-robots-kdbr)
- **Technologies**: MATLAB

## Rehabilitation Biomechanics
- **Description**: As a final project, I analyzed motion capture, sEMG, and GRF signals based on an experiment conducted in my lab. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/eladsimantov/Rehabilitation-Biomechanics/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#rehabilitation-biomechanics)
- **Technologies**: MATLAB


## Robot Navigation
- **Description**: A project focused on implementing various navigation algorithms in MATLAB to solve the Bed Mover problem.
- **Technologies**: MATLAB, DFS, BFS and A* algorithms


## Inertial Navigation System (INS)



## Applied Machine Learning for Engineers
